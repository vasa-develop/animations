        Feel free to pause the video here and think about how just by changing the
        way we add 2 different numbers, we have made it a lot harder to brute force
        the secret. While it is not clear at first, this small change in using
        modular arithmetic increases the security of our secret-sharing system by
        a lot.

        To recap what we have learned until now, we started by sharing an 8-digit
        secret between you and your friend and we mentioned that this naive
        approach has 2 problems. The first problem was to find a way to share
        a secret such that a person with a secret share has the same probability
        of brute-forcing the secret as a person without a secret share.

        As we saw, adding randomness to our secret and using modular arithmetic
        helped us to solve this problem.
